# Geo-Location Reward System

## Overview
The Geo-Location Reward System is a blockchain-based solution to monitor attendance for employees and students. It leverages geo-location check-ins to reward users with points, ensuring proper attendance tracking with minimal human intervention.

## Features
- **Automated Attendance Tracking**: Users check in at specific locations to register their attendance.
- **Reward System**: Earn points for timely check-ins.
- **Blockchain-Based**: Transparent and tamper-proof attendance records.
- **Minimal Human Intervention**: Reduces manual tracking efforts.
- **Decentralized & Secure**: Ensures data integrity and prevents fraudulent entries.

## Smart Contract Details
- **Deployed Address**: `0x28AEd5d5B672949f475410d5285AC2e07e6DC468`
- **Blockchain Network**: Edu Chain

## Initial Setup
1. **Install MetaMask**: 
   - Download and install the MetaMask extension for your browser.
   - Set up your wallet and secure your seed phrase.
   - Connect MetaMask to the Edu Chain network.

2. **Connect to EduChain**:
   - Open MetaMask and go to "Networks."
   - Add a custom RPC for Edu Chain using the appropriate details.

3. **HackQuest Account**:
   - Register on HackQuest to get access to blockchain development resources.
   - Use HackQuest to test and interact with smart contracts.

4. **Using Remix for Deployment**:
   - Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
   - Load the `GeoLocationRewards` smart contract.
   - Compile and deploy it on the Edu Chain using your MetaMask wallet.

## How It Works
1. A user checks in at a predefined location.
2. The smart contract records the check-in timestamp.
3. Reward points are assigned to the user.
4. The accumulated points can be used for attendance validation and incentives.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AppoorvaBansal/Geo-Location-Rewards.git
   ```
2. Deploy the smart contract on the Edu Chain.
3. Interact with the contract using a web3-enabled frontend or CLI.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with mobile apps for seamless check-ins.
- Dynamic reward calculation based on attendance patterns.
- AI-driven fraud detection for attendance manipulation prevention.
